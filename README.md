# LED Blinking (Soldering required)
Sample source code for DIY PR1A. LED blinking is the simplest PIC microcontroller project. With just 3 simple steps, you can make the LEDs blinking by using the PIC16F84A. We strongly believe that this project is a very good kick-start to learn about programming microcontroller for the beginners.

There is 3 folder which are Source code( .c and .hex), Sample code using MPLABX and sample code using MPLAB(Using MPLAB 8.6 And HiTech 9.80) Welcome to our tecnical forum for any inquiry. http://forum.cytron.com.my/
